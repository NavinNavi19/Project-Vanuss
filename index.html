I have been involved in the IT security industry for over an year and a half as a Security Adiministrator.I am also a Tech Enthusiast and also love to stay updated in the world of technology. Starting this website as a place for the collection of technical knowledge, personal experiences that I am learning.
	I have gone through all the advanced HTML, CSS and PHP webpage templates, but with I was not able to customize website to my needs. So I am starting with the basic HTML page and work through improving the look and contents on a daily basis.
