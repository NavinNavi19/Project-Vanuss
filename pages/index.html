      <h4>Greetings,</h4>
        
      <p>This is Navin from an InfoSec background with over a year and half experience as a Security Adiministrator.I am also a Tech Enthusiast who love to stay updated in the world of technology. I have started this website in the view of sharing my technical knowledge, personal experiences in parallel to my learning.I hope to update the contents and the look of this webpage once in two weeks.</p>
        
      <p>With that said above, I have a little knowledge about basic programming also. But first when I decided to open a blog, I was put into a situation where I was not able to customize website to my needs. Because Wordpress and many other CMS have free blogging template but written in advanced HTML, CSS and PHP webpage template(well atleast I felt that way). So I started learning and developing web pages during the day and break them in the night to exploit the vulnerabilities. </p>
        
	  <p>Finally I hope you will find something worth your time.</p>
